# 📝 Camperbot Blog Page — Bug Fixing Practice

## 📅 Project Completion
**Today (2026-02-03), I completed this project.**

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I practiced fixing bugs in a blog-style web page and improving its overall structure and presentation. This workshop exercise from freeCodeCamp helped me strengthen my debugging skills and better understand how different HTML page components work together.

I also added custom CSS styling to the page to better understand layout components and visual structure.

## 🎯 What I Practiced and Learned
Through this project, I practiced:

- Fixing HTML structure and logic bugs
- Using semantic HTML elements:
  - `<nav>`
  - `<main>`
  - `<article>`
  - `<footer>`
- Creating internal navigation with anchor links
- Improving page organization and readability
- Applying CSS borders and styles to visualize page sections
- Understanding how different page components connect together

This exercise improved my confidence in debugging and refining web pages.
