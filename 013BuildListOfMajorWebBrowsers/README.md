# 🌐 List of Major Web Browsers

## 📅 Project Completion
**Today (2026-01-30), I completed this project.**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a simple and structured list of major web browsers using **HTML description lists** and **basic CSS styling**. I created it as a practice project to better understand how semantic HTML elements work together with styling.

The page displays browser names along with short descriptions, presented in a clean and readable format, with a custom color theme added using CSS.

## 🎯 What I Practiced and Learned
Through this project, I practiced:

- Using the HTML **description list** elements:
  - `<dl>` for the list container
  - `<dt>` for browser names
  - `<dd>` for browser descriptions
- Applying basic **CSS styling** to improve visual appearance
- Separating structure (HTML) from presentation (CSS)
- Writing clean and readable markup

I also added my own styling touches to personalize the project and reinforce my understanding of CSS.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
