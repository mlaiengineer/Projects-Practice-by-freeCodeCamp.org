# 📊 Tech Conference Schedule Table — HTML Practice

## 📅 Project Completion
**Today (2026-02-05), I completed this project.**

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I practiced building a structured conference schedule table using HTML. The page represents a multi-track tech conference timetable and demonstrates how to organize data clearly using rows and columns.

This exercise helped me better understand how to design readable tables and apply proper HTML table semantics, along with adding CSS styling for visual clarity.

## 🎯 What I Practiced and Learned
Through this project, I practiced:

- Creating tables using:
  - `<table>`
  - `<thead>` and `<tbody>`
  - `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`
- Working effectively with **rows and columns**
- Using accessibility-related attributes like:
  - `scope="col"` and `scope="row"`
- Using `colspan` to merge columns for shared events like breaks and lunch
- Adding a table `<caption>` for better semantic meaning
- Styling HTML elements using CSS classes
- Reviewing and reinforcing my previous CSS knowledge

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
