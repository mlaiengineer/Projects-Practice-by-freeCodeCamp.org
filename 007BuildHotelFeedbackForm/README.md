Welcome to the **Hotel Feedback Form** workshop!

This project is a culmination of my studies on building forms, with concepts learned from the **freeCodeCamp Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum**. While the core of this project is based on the freeCodeCamp curriculum, I've added my own custom touches to the CSS and included an Arabic version of the feedback form to enhance the user experience.

My journey in web development is ongoing, and this project represents a significant step forward in my learning.

*Completed on August 27, 2025.*
