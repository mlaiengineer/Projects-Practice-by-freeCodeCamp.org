**📝 Survey Form Project**

Welcome to the Survey Form Project — a hands-on HTML lab created by `@mlaiengineer`, inspired by `@freeCodeCamp`. This project is part of the `Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum` Certificate.

**🌟 What I Did**
In this lab, I completed the required tasks and added my own customizations, including:

🗣️ A bilingual (Arabic) version of the page

🎨 Personalized styling for the form

🧩 Enhanced structure using semantic HTML elements like `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, and more

These additions helped me solidify my understanding of HTML fundamentals and improve consistency in layout and design.
