# 🎬 Video Display Using iframe Element

## 📅 Project Completion
**Today (2026-01-30), I completed this project.**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to display a YouTube video on a web page using the **HTML `<iframe>` element**. I built this project as a hands-on practice to better understand how iframes work and how external content can be embedded into a webpage.

I was inspired by **freeCodeCamp**, which helped me grasp the practical usage of iframes and their related attributes through learning and experimentation.

## 🎯 What I Learned
Through this project, I practiced and learned:

- How to embed videos using the `<iframe>` element
- Understanding important iframe attributes such as:
  - `src`
  - `allow`
  - `allowfullscreen`
  - `referrerpolicy`
- How to control iframe dimensions (`width` and `height`)
- Writing clean and structured HTML

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**

## 📂 Project Structure

├── index.html



## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. The embedded YouTube video will load automatically inside the iframe

## 🙏 Credits
- Inspired by **freeCodeCamp**
- Thanks to the freeCodeCamp community for providing high-quality learning resources

## 🚀 Journey Continues
This project is part of my continuous learning journey in web development and AI. More projects and improvements are coming soon!
